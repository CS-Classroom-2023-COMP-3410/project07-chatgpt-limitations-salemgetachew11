I enhanced the memory matching game to better engage users and improve its visual appeal. I added dynamic centering to the game container so it stays centered no matter how the window size changes, using a JavaScript function called centerGameContainer. This function adjusts the container's position when the page loads and whenever the window is resized. I also updated the CSS for responsive design, making sure the game looks good on different devices by using properties like position: absolute and transform. For functionality, I implemented JavaScript to shuffle cards, manage game states, and handle interactions like card flips and match checks. These updates ensure the game works smoothly across various browsers and devices, providing a dynamic and fun experience. I thoroughly tested the game in different settings to ensure everything works well together, confirming the game's performance and responsiveness.

I made several enhancements to the Memory Matching Game to support multiplayer functionality and resolve image display issues. Multiplayer Support: I introduced multiplayer features to allow two players to take turns and keep track of their scores. The game now alternates between Player 1 and Player 2 after each turn, and updates their scores based on successful matches. This was implemented by adjusting the game's JavaScript logic to manage player states and update the UI accordingly, ensuring a competitive and engaging experience. Image Display Fixes: To address issues with images not appearing, I ensured that the image paths used in the JavaScript were correctly mapped to the locations in the project directory. This involved modifying the game setup function to dynamically generate card elements with the correct image URLs, enhancing reliability and ease of maintenance.Functionality and Testing: The game's functionality now includes robust multiplayer interactions with clear indications of whose turn it is and real-time score tracking. For testing, itâ€™s important to verify the game on multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior and check that all images load correctly under various conditions. This ensures that the game provides a smooth and enjoyable experience for all users.
